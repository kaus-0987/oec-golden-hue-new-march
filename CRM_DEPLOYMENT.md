# CRM Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Changes Made (Ready to Deploy)

### 1. Fixed Route Conflict
- **Moved**: `/src/app/oeccrm/` → `/src/app/crm-launcher/`
- **Reason**: Next.js page was blocking URL rewrites
- **Impact**: `/oeccrm/*` routes now free for CRM access

### 2. Updated next.config.mjs
- Added specific rewrite: `/oeccrm/login` → `/crm/index.html`
- Added wildcard rewrite: `/oeccrm/:path*` → `/crm/index.html`
- Added CSP headers for `/oeccrm/:path*` routes
- Maintains proper asset loading from `/crm/static/*`

### 3. Updated netlify.toml
- Reordered redirects for better handling
- Added specific redirect: `/oeccrm/login` → `/crm/index.html`
- Maintained asset redirects: `/oeccrm/*` → `/crm/:splat`

## 🚀 Deploy to Netlify

### Option 1: Git Push (Recommended)
```bash
# Stage all changes

```

### Option 2: Manual Deploy

```

## ✅ Verification Steps (After Deployment)

- [ ] `https://oecdubai.com/oeccrm/login`
- [ ] `https://oecdubai.netlify.app/oeccrm/login`
- [ ] `https://oecdubai.com/crm/login`

### 2. Check Browser Console

- [ ] JavaScript files load successfully
- [ ] CSS files load successfully

### 3. Test CRM Functionality

## 🐛 If Issues Occur

### CRM Shows 404
1. Check `/public/crm/` folder exists
2. Verify `index.html` is present
3. Check Netlify deployment logs
4. Clear CDN cache in Netlify dashboard

### Blank Page
1. Open browser DevTools Console
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Verify CSP headers (Network tab)
4. Check asset paths in Network tab

### Still Seeing Launcher Page
1. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Verify deployment completed
3. Check build logs for compilation errors
4. Ensure `src/app/oeccrm/` doesn't exist

## 📊 Expected Results

**Before Fix:**
```
/oeccrm/login → Next.js launcher page ❌
```

**After Fix:**
```
/oeccrm/login → CRM React App ✅
/crm/login → CRM React App ✅
/crm-launcher → Launcher page ✅
```

## 💡 Technical Details

### How It Works:

1. **User Request**: Browser requests `/oeccrm/login`
2. **Next.js Rewrite**: Internally maps to `/crm/index.html`
3. **File Served**: `/public/crm/index.html` sent to browser
4. **Assets Loaded**: CRM loads scripts from `/crm/static/js/...`
5. **React Router**: CRM handles `/login` route internally
6. **Success**: Full CRM application loads

### URL Mapping:

```
User sees:     /oeccrm/login
Next.js maps:  /crm/index.html
Browser gets:  public/crm/index.html
Assets from:   public/crm/static/*
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ CRM loads at `https://oecdubai.com/oeccrm/login`  
✅ No 404 errors in console  
✅ All CRM features work properly  
✅ No CSP violations  
✅ Fast loading times
