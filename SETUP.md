# OEC Dubai Website - Quick Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local and add your OpenAI API key
# IMPORTANT: Use OPENAI_API_KEY (NOT NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY)
```

Your `.env.local` should look like:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key-here
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 3. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000

### 4. Run Tests (Optional)
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 🔧 What Changed?

### ✅ AI College Finder Now Works!
The AI College Finder was not working because:
- OpenAI API key was exposed on the client-side
- No proper error handling

**Fixed by:**
- Moving OpenAI calls to secure server-side API routes
- Adding proper error messages
- Better loading states

### ✅ Better Code Organization
Large components (600+ lines) have been split into smaller, manageable pieces:
- `AICollegeFinder` → 7 smaller components
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easier to test and maintain

### ✅ Testing Infrastructure
Can now run automated tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### ✅ Security Improvements
- API keys are server-side only
- No sensitive data exposed to browser
- Proper environment variable configuration

## 📝 Environment Variables Explained

### Required Variables

**OPENAI_API_KEY** (Server-side only)
- Used for AI-powered features
- Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- **NEVER** use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix (that would expose it!)

**NODE_ENV**
- `development` for local development
- `production` for deployment

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### AI College Finder shows "API key not configured"
1. Check that `.env.local` exists
2. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set (without NEXT_PUBLIC prefix)
3. Restart the development server

### Tests failing
1. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Check that Jest is properly configured
3. Run `npm test -- --verbose` for detailed output

### Port 3000 already in use
```bash
# Kill the process using port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Or use a different port
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```
